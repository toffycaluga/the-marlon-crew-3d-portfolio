# The Marlon Crew – 3D Portfolio

An immersive 3D portfolio created for **The Marlon Crew**, designed to showcase a real-scale circus environment through interactive visuals, dynamic lighting, and spatial composition.

This project combines artistic direction and technical implementation to present a digital stage inspired by real circus productions.

---

## 🎪 Project Overview

This 3D portfolio represents a custom-built circus stage featuring:

- Real-world scale geometry
- Custom truss and stage structures
- Programmable moving-head lighting
- Scene-based lighting presets
- Interactive camera views

The goal is not to simulate a full show, but to **communicate identity, atmosphere, and technical precision** through an immersive experience.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- **Real-scale 3D environment** inspired by professional circus setups  
- **Modular moving-head lighting system**, grouped and data-driven  
- **Scene-based lighting control** tied to camera views  
- **Custom-built structures** (stage, truss, towers, dome, backstage)  
- **Smooth camera navigation** for exploration and presentation  
- **Performance-conscious architecture** using reusable components  

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Three.js** – 3D rendering and scene management  
- **JavaScript (ES Modules)** – modular architecture  
- **Custom lighting rig system** – data-driven positioning and grouping  
- **Post-processing effects** – bloom and tone mapping  

No external 3D models are used — all structures are built procedurally.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This project follows a few core principles:

- **Data over hardcoding** – lights and rigs are defined through configuration files  
- **Separation of concerns** – visuals, logic, and control layers are clearly separated  
- **Real-world inspiration** – dimensions and layouts reflect real circus setups  
- **Clarity over complexity** – systems are designed to be readable and extensible  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as:

- A **creative and technical portfolio**
- A way to explore **lighting design concepts** in 3D
- A foundation for future **interactive or visualization tools**

It is not intended as a generic engine or production-ready framework.
